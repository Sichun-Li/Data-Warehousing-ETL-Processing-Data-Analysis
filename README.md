# Data Warehousing-ETL Processing & Data-Analysis
This project was to design and build a data warehouse for the Blue Hill Country Club to organzie the membership and transactional data related to one year of operations(10 tables, 50,000+ rows). The data warehouse was to add value to the organization in terms of ease of use (for a technically competent user but not necessarily a programmer) and efficacy in identifying relevant patterns and trends.<br>
After building the data warehouse, I wrote ad-hoc analytics queries to help answer business questions.<br>

Tool: SQL, Tableau

* created EER diagram and relational schema  <br>
* implemented ETL(extract,transform and load) data processing and built a data warehouse <br>
* extracted data warehouse records and wrote queries to analyze the performance of categories, purchase patterns of different types of customers and promotion effectiveness  <br>
* visualized the results with Tableau  <br>
