# Data Warehousing-ETL Processing & Data-Analysis
This project was to design and build a data warehouse for the Blue Hill Country Club to reorganzie the membership and transactional data from 10 tables related to one year of operations. The data warehouse was to add value to the organization in terms of ease of use (for a technically computer user but not necessarily a programmer) and efficacy in identifying relevant patterns and trends.<br>
After building the data warehouse, I wrote ad-hoc analytics queries to help answer business questions.<br>

Tool: SQL, Tableau

* created EER diagram and relational schema  <br>
* implemented ETL(extract,transform and load) data processing and built a data warehouse <br>
* wrote ad-hoc queries to extract records from the data warehouse and analyze the performance of categories, purchase patterns of different membership type groups, promotion effectiveness and etc. <br>
* visualized the results with Tableau  <br>
