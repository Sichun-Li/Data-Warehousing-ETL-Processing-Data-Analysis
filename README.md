# Data Warehousing-ETL Processing & Data-Analysis
This project was to design and build an efficient and easy to use data warehouse for the Blue Hill Country Club to organize 50,000+ transaction data from ten tables related to one year of operation.
Then using the built data warehouse, I performed customer analysis to gain insights about service purchase patterns.  <br>

Tool: SQL, Tableau

* created EER diagram and relational schema  <br>
* converted dates and standardized string  <br>
* implemented ETL(extract,transform and load) data processing  <br>
* extracted data warehouse records to analyze the performance of categories, the consumption preference of different types of customers and promotion effectiveness  <br>
* visualized the results with Tableau  <br>
